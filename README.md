# Unexpected Output from Type Coercion in JavaScript
This code demonstrates an example of type coercion in JavaScript that leads to unexpected results.  When adding a number and a string, JavaScript's loose typing system converts the number to a string, resulting in string concatenation instead of numerical addition. 

The `bug.js` file shows the unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.js` offers a solution using type checking or explicit conversion.
